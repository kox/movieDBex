# movieDBex

This is just an example of a web application using some of the latest libraries.

The main feature is to implement a simple website where users can search for films depending of the title of the film.

The idea is to implement this example in short time, so I will omit common considerations like stylesheet, html frameworks to enhace the user experience and I will focus in the model data.

## Approach

For this application, I will integrate a solid solution based in React and Redux. It's my first application using Redux so I hope to keep the idea of redux clean and usable.

## Workflow

To implement this appication, I will follow this workflow:
1- Install list of packages required
2- Prepare the stack to run ES6 using babel and integrate hot loading for agile development
3- Create basic React Components where the information will be rendered
4- Implement Redux actions, reducers and store
5- Connect the React handlers with the actions and render the state
6- Testing
7- Documentation
